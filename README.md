# TDI project proposal: Analyzing Airbnb data  



## Project 

A first step is to analyze the Airbnb data using various machine learning techniques. Build model for prediction of prices, sentiment analysis, and profit prediction etc. Applying deep learning and NLP methods for a deeper analysis. Then we can focus on getting more data and look at the time trend of prices related to several most important features that we get in the first step, which gives us a time-depent model for pridicting prices etc.

## Requirement and timeline
It will be valuable if the end users can use the model for setting their prices and make profits which takes considerations about future changes. The first step definitely can be completed, for the second step we may need more time.

## Existing models
Something similar to 1st step already exists, but the second step might not to considered as much as the first one, which I believe it is valuable.

## Potential end-users
It could be either rental companies/individuals or travel companies or real estate agents, which shares some common properties of Airbnb data. This problem is not urgent, but it will be profitable in the long run. 

## Data
Basic data: U.S. Airbnb Open Data. Ideally we should have a time-dependent Airbnb data (or other similar ones should be sufficient). The difficulty is to combined different sources of data into a organized one, which needs a lots of data cleaning and wrangling. We need a good data crawling skills as well as data processing skills.  

## Deliver the result
We can use a time-dependent train-validation procedure (or some kinds of cross-validations), and there are bunch of metrics can be applied, and we may adjust them for our purpose. Finally, we will use various data visualizations to show our results.
